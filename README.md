An intermediate-level Python project idea related to the banking industry: A simple Bank Account Management System. This system allows customers to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money, check balance, and transfer funds between accounts.

Features:
Create an account with basic details (name, account number, and initial deposit).
Deposit money into an account.
Withdraw money from an account (checking for sufficient funds).
Check account balance.
Transfer money between accounts (checking for sufficient balance).
View transaction history.
Steps to Build:
1. Set Up the Classes
We'll have two main classes:

Account for individual customer accounts.
Bank for managing all accounts and transactions.
2. Implement Functions for Each Feature
Each of the features will be implemented as methods within the Account and Bank classes.

Explanation of Code:
Account class:

Attributes: account_holder (name), balance (current balance), account_number (unique identifier), transactions (history of operations).
Methods:
deposit: Adds money to the balance.
withdraw: Subtracts money from the balance (if there are sufficient funds).
check_balance: Prints the current balance.
get_transaction_history: Lists all transactions.
Bank class:

Attributes: accounts (a dictionary storing accounts with account numbers as keys).
Methods:
create_account: Creates a new account and adds it to the accounts dictionary.
get_account: Fetches an account by account number.
transfer: Allows transferring funds between two accounts.
